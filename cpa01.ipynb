#This data set describes different evaluation of corruption in 180 countries
#Found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/transparencyint/corruption-index
#Are the different measurements of corruption in agreement?
#What are the 5 most corrupt countries?

#For my first question, the graph shoes a general trend of agreement between CPI and Global Insight Country Risk Ratings
#For my second Question, the 5 most corrupt countries are Sudan, Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, and Somalia
